# CarbonCalculator
The CarbonCalculator is a feature that can calculate the total output of carbon, in grams, and show an itemized list of each ride and how much carbon it attributed that is generated by the user for a certain month. 
The reason why the CarbonCalculator is useful is because if the user want to know what their carbon output has been for the last month then they will be able to see what ride contributed.
